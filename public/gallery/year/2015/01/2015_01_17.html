<H2>OrigaMIT Meeting Winter 2015</H2>
<b>January 17th, 2015</b>
<p>
We had the amazing privilege of hosting origami artist Vincent Floderer, who gave a talk about the biomimetic folding and crumpling techniques he has developed over the years. Over 60 people turned out despite the cold! After the lecture, we also got the chance to try out crumpling techniques ourselves with napkins and tissue paper. Thanks, Vincent!</p>
