<H2>OrigaMIT Meeting Spring 2015</H2>
<b>April 5th, 2015</b>
<p>Today was the opening of our annual campus exhibition! The display in the Wiesner Gallery (on the second floor of the student center) showcases submissions for the 14th Annual Student OrigaMIT Competition! It will be up for the entire month of April.</p>

<p>Here are <a href="S15_competition_winners.pdf">the results of the competition</a>. Congratulations to all award-winners!</p>

<p>This year's competition was judged by a panel with incredible combined folding experience and longtime affiliation with the club. Learn more about <a href="S15_origamit_competitionJudges.pdf">the judges here.</a></p>

<p>After the exhibit opening, we went to W20-491 as usual and learnt to fold Robert Lang's turtle.</p>
